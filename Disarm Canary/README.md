# Disarm Canary script
Written for Python 3

I have a co-worker who loves to put canary tokens in his word documents. Office documents are just zipped XML files. I built this script to list any URLs hidden those XML files, then give you the option to remove them.

I haven't tested this with malicous Office docs, but it should work in theory.
